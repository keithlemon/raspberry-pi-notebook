# Raspbian

## Base  Iso

There are many images that you can start iwth. I'm attempting to start off with the most light wight version and only add.  I do plan at some point soon in the future switching over to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Runtime Setup

Install .NET Core on Raspbain

Please note that you cannot do any development on the Raspberry Pi as the .NET Core SDK does not support ARM processesors.  From my reading it doesn't sound like this will be changing any time soon.
